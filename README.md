# DiskCoin

DiskCoin is the fun and educative Rust-written cryptocurrency mining. One is able to create a wallet, mine the DiskCoins using a simple PoW mechanism, and receive airdrops once a week.

## Features

Wallet generation creates a unique wallet that keeps the balance of the user's DiskCoin.
- **Mining**: One mines DiskCoins by solving complex mathematical problems provided as part of the proof of work.
- **AIRDROPS**: a nice complementary possibility for the user to receive random quantities of DiskCoins thanks to airdrops, although it is limited in frequency once a week.
Balance Check: One can verify the balance of his or her present DiskCoin.
